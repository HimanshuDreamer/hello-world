# hello-world
This is my first GIT Repository. A Repository usually used to organize a Single Project.Repository can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheet and data sets
By default your repository have one branch named "master" which is considered to be the definitive branch. we use branches to experiments and make edits before committing them to "master".
When you create a branch off the "master" branch, you are making a copy, or snapshot of "master", as it was at that point of time.
if someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those request.
